# pizzeria-exercise

This is my implementation of a programming exercise from class, which had roughly these requirements:
- Get the name, location (coordinates, as double), and working hours of several pizzerias
- Get the location of the user (coordinates, as double, again)

Return the closest pizzeria that is open, at the current time (when the program is run)
